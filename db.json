This book lists techniques for analyzing financial charts, but I was perhaps too naive in applying them, as my bot never quite made money.\n\n2. **(⭕️) Mendeleyev's Dream: The Quest for the Elements by Paul Strathern**\n\nThis book covers the entire history of chemistry from alchemy to modern times. Mendeleyev, who created the periodic table, teaches us that no effort is wasted. The alchemists' quest to turn common materials into gold led to the chemistry we know today.\n\n3. **(⭕️) Meditations by Marcus Aurelius**\n\n**I highly recommend this book to those who haven't read it yet.** This book is essentially the diary of Marcus Aurelius, offering profound insights into self-reflection. It's fascinating to see how a Roman emperor, despite having immense power, maintained modesty and virtue. His thoughts on nature and life continue to resonate, prompting me to revisit this book occasionally.\n\n4. **(⭕️) Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman**\n\nKahneman introduces two types of thinking: System 1, which is fast and instinctual, and System 2, which is slow and deliberate. It's intriguing how System 1 can influence our decisions without our conscious awareness, despite seeming logical.\n\n5. **(⭕️) Everybody lies: big data, new data, and what the Internet can tell us about who we really are by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz**\n\nThis book convinced me of the power of data science. The use of Google Trends as an anonymous statistical tool was particularly enlightening.\n\n6. **(❌) 도시는 무엇으로 사는가 : 도시를 보는 열다섯 가지 인문적 시선 by 유현준**\n\n.\n\n\n7. **(❌) The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom by Don Miguel Ruiz**\n\n.\n\n8. **(❌) Why Fish Don't Exist: A Story of Loss, Love, and the Hidden Order of Life by Lulu Miller**\n\nThis book underscores the importance of belief. Jordan succeeded because he did what he believed was necessary and important. His self-belief helped him persevere despite setbacks.\n\n9. **(❌) Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson**\n\nReading about Musk is inspiring. He is seen as a true genius, living life to the fullest with a clear sense of purpose.\n\n10. **(⭕️) A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins**\n\nOne of the most inspiring books I've read. It explores a new theory about the brain, suggesting that AI models should emulate natural processes proven effective by evolution. Although complex, it's a must-read for AI researchers.\n\n11. **(⭕️) Klara and the Sun: A novel by Kazuo Ishiguro**\n\nWhat makes super intelligent robot different from humans? Can a being be completely replaced by such robot? This novel explores what distinguishes super-intelligent robots from humans and whether such beings can fully replace humans. It delves into profound questions about our future.\n\n12. **(❌) McMindfulness : how mindfulness became the new capitalist spirituality by Purser Ronald**\n\nOne of the fundamental questions of life I have is whether mindfulness, or more commonly meditation, really something as it is promoted by almost every celebrities and co-opted by many corporations and even military.

Although I enjoy reading, I often struggle with novels as I find it challenging to remember the names and messages behind the stories. I prefer reading material that presents information explicitly rather than implicitly.</p>\n<p>When it comes to language, I have a strong preference for reading in English over Korean, despite Korean being my native language. If someone were to ask me why I read books in English (people actually do quite a lot), my answer would revolve around my perception of books and the aspects of them that I value.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I view books as media for information that are composed by authors and written in words. There may be more elaborate and fancy definitions, but this is how I fundamentally see books. The way authors compose information and the nuances in their writing are important to me. This is one of the primary reasons I read books in English—I want to appreciate the books as the authors intended.</p>\n<p>Secondly, and more importantly, I read books to improve my literacy. Given that books are written in words, improving my literacy is crucial. In today’s world, English is widely regarded as the global language. Most of the information I seek is likely to be written in English. Therefore, it makes sense for me to enhance my English literacy rather than focusing solely on Korean. My Korean literacy naturally improves as I live in Korea and am surrounded by visual information in Korean. I have no issues reading and communicating in Korean, and that is sufficient for my needs.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"clwyq2m7e00018wp9eq874rec","tag_id":"clwyqr93b00098wp9fdqv60gi","_id":"clwyqr93d000a8wp98tod4pz0"},{"post_id":"clwypsd9700008wp901fifio6","tag_id":"clwyqr93b00098wp9fdqv60gi","_id":"clwywixt00000u9p95coh975y"},{"post_id":"clwyq2m7e00018wp9eq874rec","tag_id":"clwz0h86x00002gp91jzt61yr","_id":"clwz0h87h00012gp9cklh8vig"}],"Tag":[{"name":"Books","_id":"clwyq31la00028wp9d2kw79do"},{"name":"Books, More","_id":"clwyq49jj00058wp92rucagut"},{"name":"Book","_id":"clwyq4r7e00078wp9cb07eayb"},{"name":"Book 📚","_id":"clwyqr93b00098wp9fdqv60gi"},{"name":"Thoughts 💭","_id":"clwz0h86x00002gp91jzt61yr"}]}}
