Hi 👋, my name is Hyun Kang. I am a Master's student at the <a href="https://cga.yonsei.ac.kr/\">Computer Graphics and Applications Lab</a>, Yonsei University, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4id34ogAAAAJ&hl=ko\">Prof. In-Kwon Lee</a>. Before joining graduate school, I received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University.
<br/>
👀 My research interests are 3D reconstruction and generative models. I believe that almost every area of research will, if not already, benefit from general knowledge or priors in large models. 
</br>
👨‍🦯 As a person, I love reading books 📚 (<a href="/2024/05/28/books_in_graduate/">see the list of books I read during graduate school</a>), exploring fashion 👔, and attending exhibitions 🖼️. I think what they share in common is that little details matter a lot. Many authors share similar ideas, but what makes a book distinguishable among many others is the small insights. Similarly, little details are what give identity to fashion and artworks. I also strive to have my own opinion on everything I believe matters, and this makes me unique.
