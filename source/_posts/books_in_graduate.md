During graduate school, reading books broadened my perspective on various research topics. Fortunately, my school had one of the best libraries in the country, giving me access to almost any book I wished to read. If a book wasn’t available, I could simply request it, and they would acquire it within a few months 😘. After finishing a book, I would often buy it to have my own copy if I liked it good enough.

Borrowing books from the library allowed me to keep a complete list of the books I read, whether or not I owned them. I'd like to share this list with some notes and whether I have a personal copy.

1. **(❌) 차트의 해석 : <<차트의 기술>> 김정환 저자의 기술적 분석 심화 편 by 김정환**

As a graduate student on a tight budget, I sought financial freedom by attempting to build an automated trading bot based on chart analysis. This book lists techniques for analyzing financial charts, but I was perhaps too naive in applying them, as my bot never quite made money.

2. **(⭕️) Mendeleyev's Dream: The Quest for the Elements by Paul Strathern**

This book covers the entire history of chemistry from alchemy to modern times. Mendeleyev, who created the periodic table, teaches us that no effort is wasted. The alchemists' quest to turn common materials into gold led to the chemistry we know today.

3. **(⭕️) Meditations by Marcus Aurelius**

**I highly recommend this book to those who haven't read it yet.** This book is essentially the diary of Marcus Aurelius, offering profound insights into self-reflection. It's fascinating to see how a Roman emperor, despite having immense power, maintained modesty and virtue. His thoughts on nature and life continue to resonate, prompting me to revisit this book occasionally.

4. **(⭕️) Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman**

Kahneman introduces two types of thinking: System 1, which is fast and instinctual, and System 2, which is slow and deliberate. It's intriguing how System 1 can influence our decisions without our conscious awareness, despite seeming logical.

5. **(⭕️) Everybody lies: big data, new data, and what the Internet can tell us about who we really are by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz**

This book convinced me of the power of data science. The use of Google Trends as an anonymous statistical tool was particularly enlightening.

6. **(❌) 도시는 무엇으로 사는가 : 도시를 보는 열다섯 가지 인문적 시선 by 유현준**

.


7. **(❌) The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom by Don Miguel Ruiz**

.

8. **(❌) Why Fish Don't Exist: A Story of Loss, Love, and the Hidden Order of Life by Lulu Miller**

This book underscores the importance of belief. Jordan succeeded because he did what he believed was necessary and important. His self-belief helped him persevere despite setbacks.

9. **(❌) Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson**

Reading about Musk is inspiring. He is seen as a true genius, living life to the fullest with a clear sense of purpose.

10. **(⭕️) A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins**

One of the most inspiring books I've read. It explores a new theory about the brain, suggesting that AI models should emulate natural processes proven effective by evolution. Although complex, it's a must-read for AI researchers.

11. **(⭕️) Klara and the Sun: A novel by Kazuo Ishiguro**

What makes super intelligent robot different from humans? Can a being be completely replaced by such robot? This novel explores what distinguishes super-intelligent robots from humans and whether such beings can fully replace humans. It delves into profound questions about our future.

12. **(❌) McMindfulness : how mindfulness became the new capitalist spirituality by Purser Ronald**

One of the fundamental questions of life I have is whether mindfulness, or more commonly meditation, really something as it is promoted by almost every celebrities and co-opted by many corporations and even military. This book challenges the commercialization of mindfulness and meditation, presenting them as tools for social change rather than individual betterment as commonly promoted.
