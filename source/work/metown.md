### Summary
As a member of the start-up company "Metown," which aims to solve the virtual fitting problem by 3D modeling human bodies and clothes, I conducted research on new virtual fitting technologies and proposed visions for future development. Additionally, I promoted our innovations by presenting at start-up hubs around the world, including in Singapore in 2022 and France in 2023.
