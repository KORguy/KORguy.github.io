### Summary
I developed the initial ideas for a start-up called "VBody," which aims to analyze 3D body shape and muscle growth by reconstructing human bodies using a 3D scanner and measuring the differences over time. The idea was presented at '2023 Graduate Student Startup Competition' and won the grand prize. The project is now being led by Dogyu Lee.
