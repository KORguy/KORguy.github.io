### Summary
ClothCombo is a project aimed at developing a model that can drape multiple layers of clothing on a human body without relying on heavy physically based simulations. My role in this project involved researching related papers, fine-tuning the models, and writing the paper. Among all my contributions, I believe the most significant was emphasizing the model's ability to handle different combinations of clothing rather than solely focusing on the accuracy of the draping. The paper was presented at SIGGRAPH ASIA 2023, held in Sydney.
